# Interview Scheduler
Interview Scheduler is a React application that allows users to book, cancel and edit interview appointments with an interviewer of their choosing.

This was my first project using React, Storybook, Jest and Cypress and I definitely enjoyed it! All of these tools solidified just how valuable building applications in smaller modules/components can be and also the importance of adding various testing strategies into your regular routine and habits.

* This was a school project
